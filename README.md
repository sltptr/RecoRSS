# RecoRSS: Content-based filtering for your RSS feeds

### Motivation

RSS is a great solution if you want to have some control over your newsfeeds, but if you follow lots of feeds then
your feed reader can become cluttered with content you'd rather not view. Large-scale services overcome this issue
with recommendation systems, and these systems employ content-based and collaborative filtering techniques which tailor
feeds to their users' preferences. The goal of RecoRSS is to provide a simple, self-hosted recommendation system that
generates a personalized RSS feed with data collected by your own viewing patterns.
