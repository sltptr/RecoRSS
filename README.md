### Motivation

RSS is a great tool for getting your updates, and having used it for the past year
I wanted to see if there was a way to filter my feeds based on my own preferences for
RSS items. RecoRSS is that solution, it's a simple recommendation system where each
item is filtered through an ensemble of machine learning models so that you only get
the RSS items you would be interested in.

### Configuration
